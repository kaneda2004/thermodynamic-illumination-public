ORCHESTRATOR CYCLE 6 - TRACK 2a: Alternative Architecture Exploration
================================================================================

EXPERIMENT: RES-240 (Dual-Channel Coordinates)
DOMAIN: dual_channel_architecture
STATUS: REFUTED
COMPLETION: 2025-12-19

HYPOTHESIS:
Using [x+y, x-y] dual-channel coordinates instead of standard [x, y, r]
achieves effective dimensionality ≤3.0D with ≥2× sampling speedup.

RESULT:
Dual-channel coordinate transformation FAILED across all variants. Effective
dimensionality remained 3.75-4.01D (target ≤3.0), and sampling efficiency
showed 0.96-1.00× speedup (target ≥2.0×). Success rate plateau at 10-12%.

METRICS:
- eff_dim_reduction: 0% (achieved 3.75D vs baseline 3.76D)
- sampling_speedup: 0.97× (best variant, all ≤1.0×)
- order_quality: 0.437-0.462 (maintained but not improved)
- success_rate: 2.5%-12.5% (no improvement over baseline 10%)

KEY FINDING:
Effective dimensionality is PARAMETER-BOUND, not coordinate-bound. CPPN
parameter space (~3-4D) determines manifold dimension. Coordinate remapping
(linear transformation) cannot reduce parameter degrees of freedom. Speedup
requires architectural changes: interactions (RES-241: +2.48×), hierarchies
(RES-254: validated), or spectral bases (RES-249: in progress).

INTERPRETATION:
- Passive coordinate transformation provides no leverage
- CPPN samples ~3-4D manifolds due to parameter constraints
- Linear preprocessing doesn't add information or nonlinearity
- Contrast: interaction-enriched inputs (RES-241) show 2.48× validated speedup

RECOMMENDATION:
CLOSE dual-channel thread. Focus on interaction-enriched architectures
(proven effective) and hierarchical composition (proven effective). Coordinate
transformation alone insufficient for speedup; architectural innovation required.

NEXT RESEARCH DIRECTIONS:
1. Learned coordinate systems (AutoML for CPPN inputs)
2. Spectral bottleneck analysis (RES-249, in progress)
3. Interaction transfer across architectures (RES-246, in progress)
4. Manifold-aware sampling strategies
5. Information-theoretic optimization bounds
