# ============================================================================
# SUMMARY
# ============================================================================
executive_summary: |
  RES-049 reports a strong correlation (rho=0.899) between order and Hessian
  Frobenius norm, with high-order regions having "157x higher curvature." While
  the reported statistics are computed correctly, the experiment has critical
  methodological issues that inflate the effect size and misinterpret the results.

  Key problems:
  1. 46% of samples are uniform images with zero Hessian (confound)
  2. Frobenius norm of Hessian is NOT Fisher information (misnomer)
  3. The 157x ratio conflates "has structure" vs "has no structure"
  4. The interpretation connecting curvature to GD failure is speculative

  Excluding uniform samples, correlation drops from 0.899 to 0.625, and effect
  size from d=1.55 to d=0.90. The finding is still statistically significant
  but the mechanistic claim is overstated.

recommendation: reclassify
new_status: validated_with_caveats
suggested_summary: |
  Hessian Frobenius norm correlates with order (rho=0.625, d=0.90 excluding
  uniform samples). The 157x headline figure conflates "patterned vs uniform"
  rather than measuring continuous curvature variation. Does not explain GD
  failure - that is better explained by non-differentiability (RES-185) and
  order barriers (RES-137).

  - id: ISS-001
    type: methodology
    severity: critical
    title: 46% of samples are degenerate (uniform images)
    description: |
      23 of 50 samples produce uniform (all-black or all-white) images with
      exactly zero Hessian norm. These are not "low curvature regions" - they
      are points where the order metric is constant by construction.

      The binary nature of rendered images means small weight perturbations
      cannot change the output when all pixels are already saturated at 0 or 1.
      This is not meaningful information about the order landscape geometry.
    evidence:
      - Zero Frobenius count: 23/50 (46%)
      - All zero-Frobenius samples have order in [0.0041, 0.0043]
      - All non-zero-Frobenius samples have order in [0.0085, 0.5198]
    impact: |
      The strong correlation is driven by the binary split between
      "uniform images" (zero curvature) and "patterned images" (non-zero).
      Excluding uniform samples drops correlation from 0.899 to 0.625.
    remediation: |
      Either stratified sampling to ensure non-uniform images, or explicitly
      acknowledge the binary nature of the correlation.

    title: Frobenius norm of Hessian is NOT Fisher information
    description: |
      The code computes the Hessian of order(weights), but calls this
      "Fisher information". Fisher information is defined as:

        F_ij = E[(d log p(x|theta) / d theta_i)(d log p(x|theta) / d theta_j)]

      This requires a probabilistic model p(x|theta). The order metric is a
      deterministic function, not a probability distribution. The Hessian of
      a deterministic function measures local curvature, not Fisher information.
    evidence:
      - Code computes numerical Hessian of order metric
      - No probability model is defined
      - Fisher information definition requires likelihood function
    impact: |
      The title and interpretation are misleading. "Hessian curvature" would
      be accurate; "Fisher information" is a misnomer.
    remediation: |
      Rename to "Hessian curvature" or "local curvature" to avoid confusion.

    title: High curvature does not explain gradient descent failure
    description: |
      The experiment claims high curvature "explains why gradient methods fail."
      However:

      1. GD uses first derivatives (gradients), not second (Hessian)
      2. High curvature means gradients change quickly, not that they are zero
      3. RES-145 shows gradients INCREASE at high order (37x higher)
      4. RES-185 shows the real issue: gradients are ZERO at low order
      5. RES-137 shows order barriers exist between optima

      The actual explanation for GD failure is the non-differentiability of
      the thresholded order metric, not high Hessian curvature.
    evidence:
      - RES-145: "Gradient magnitude increases 37x during NS progression"
      - RES-185: "Order metric gradient is exactly zero in low-order regions"
      - RES-137: "Linear interpolation passes through low-order barriers"
    impact: |
      The mechanistic claim is not supported. GD fails due to zero gradients
      and non-convexity, not high curvature per se.
    remediation: |
      Remove or soften the claim about explaining GD failure. Cite RES-185
      and RES-137 for actual explanations.

    title: 157x ratio is misleading
    description: |
      The headline finding "157x higher Frobenius norm" compares:
      - Low order mean: 0.63 (includes all 23 zeros)
      - High order mean: 99.7

      This ratio is mostly driven by 0 vs non-zero, not continuous variation.
      Within non-zero samples, high-order mean is only ~2x low-order mean.
    evidence:
      - Low order group includes all 23 uniform samples (Frobenius=0)
      - Mean Frobenius among non-uniform: 92.88 +/- 90.00
      - Effect size excluding zeros: d=0.90 (still significant)
    impact: |
      The 157x figure gives a false impression of effect magnitude.
    remediation: |
      Report analysis excluding uniform samples, or use ranks/medians.

    title: Numerical Hessian stability not verified
    description: |
      The numerical Hessian uses eps=0.01 for finite differences. No
      verification that this step size is appropriate for the order metric's
      nonlinearity. The order metric involves thresholding (>0.5) which
      creates discontinuities.
    evidence:
      - Step size eps=0.01 is hardcoded
      - Order metric includes threshold at 0.5 (non-smooth)
      - No convergence check with different eps values
    impact: |
      Possible numerical artifacts in Hessian computation.
    remediation: |
      Test with multiple eps values or use automatic differentiation.

# STRENGTHS
# ============================================================================
strengths:
  - id: STR-001
    description: |
      The underlying observation is valid: non-uniform images do show higher
      Hessian norms, indicating the order landscape is more sensitive to
      weight changes in structured regions.

  - id: STR-002
    description: |
      Statistical analysis uses appropriate non-parametric tests (Spearman
      correlation, Mann-Whitney U) which are robust to non-normality.

  - id: STR-003
    description: |
      The Hessian computation uses the correct four-point stencil formula
      for mixed second derivatives.

opportunities:
  - id: OPP-001
    type: follow_up
    title: Stratified sampling to ensure non-uniform images
    description: |
      Repeat experiment with rejection sampling to exclude uniform images.
      This would give cleaner measurement of curvature variation within
      the interesting (structured) region of the order landscape.
    priority: high

    type: follow_up
    title: Connect to actual optimization dynamics
    description: |
      Test whether high curvature actually predicts optimization difficulty.
      E.g., measure correlation between local Hessian norm and number of
      GD iterations to reach a target, or ESS contraction rate.
    priority: medium

    title: Compute proper Fisher information with probabilistic model
    description: |
      Define a proper probabilistic model (e.g., Gaussian noise on weights)
      and compute true Fisher information. This would make the "information
      geometry" framing accurate.

final_assessment: |
  RES-049 makes a meaningful observation (Hessian norm correlates with order)
  but overstates it through methodological issues. The 157x headline figure
  and "Fisher information" terminology are misleading. The interpretation
  connecting curvature to GD failure is not supported by the evidence.

  Recommend:
  1. Change status to "validated_with_caveats"
  2. Update summary to exclude uniform samples (rho=0.625, d=0.90)
  3. Remove "Fisher information" terminology (use "Hessian curvature")
  4. Remove mechanistic claim about GD failure (cite RES-185/137 instead)
  5. Note that 157x conflates uniform vs non-uniform distinction
